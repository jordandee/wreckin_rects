ball texture

probably should redo collision detection completely, make it use the line intercept recursion method, find line between where ball is now and where it will move, detect if that line intersects with a block/paddle, move to the intersection spot, now calculate a new line between where the ball is and where it should go (if it was intersected at half length at first object, has half to go) and use new smaller timestep to reflect accurately and check if it hits another object, recurse, etc

fix spacebar serve, maybe leave it in somehow for quick testing tho

make it so you have to win level in one turn, blocks reset to file settings if fail

detect win level condition, say level has been won, blah to continue
make the ball a bit faster in each level

make some new levels, probably some new backgrounds too
carbon copy level 1 code for levels 1-5, only difference should be level that loads when you beat it

win game screen, restart or end
