ball texture

fix collision with paddle, i have a feeling x might be working (left side) but ball sometimes gets caught in middle when moving paddle left into it, seems to bounce off left side correctly when 
also probably a hard case about when ball is trapped between wall and paddle, should probably just make it go up then, but how to detect?

fix spacebar serve, maybe leave it in somehow for quick testing tho

make it so you have to win level in one turn, blocks reset to file settings if fail

detect win level condition, say level has been won, blah to continue
make the ball a bit faster in each level

make some new levels, probably some new backgrounds too
carbon copy level 1 code for levels 1-5, only difference should be level that loads when you beat it

win game screen, restart or end
