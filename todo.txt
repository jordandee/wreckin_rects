MUSTS

load level in a more interesting manner? fall into place? or?

when losing, delay before loading level?

make some new levels, probably some new backgrounds too
carbon copy level 1 code for levels 1-5, only difference should be level that loads when you beat it, ball speed, maybe diff background and different sounds too or just a different progression through the notes

make the ball a bit faster in each level

multi ball on last level or bonus level??

win game screen, restart or end on last level

NICE TO HAVES

redo collision detection completely, make it use the line intercept recursion method, find line between where ball is now and where it will move, detect if that line intersects with a block/paddle, move to the intersection spot, now calculate a new line between where the ball is and where it should go (if it was intersected at half length at first object, has half to go) and use new smaller timestep to reflect accurately and check if it hits another object, recurse, etc

JUICE ideas from vid

SFX: combo block hits - eg plays tone on first hit and if it hits another within a certain amount of time it plays a slightly higher tone so their can be a combo of tones increasing in pitch when it hits multiple blocks in a row

Blocks fall into place from above screen, could be linear or some quadratic, eg starts fast, slows down, overshoots a bit, then goes into place

ball gets larger when it bounces on something
ball emits particle effects when it bounces
ball leaves behind fading trail showing where it has been
ball hits shake screen so it feels more like it has a lot of force

blocks fall with gravity, shatter, and/or get knocked in direction ball was moving when hit
blocks get smaller and fade away after hit

paddle has face with eyes that watch ball and smiles when it hits the ball

and whatever you can imagine....
